# Intro

I have been using Linux for more than 3 years now. It started with Ubuntu, but then I moved to Debian which was a lot easier to use and had better packages available. Later on, I moved over to Arch Linux which was perfect for my needs because it was lightweight and had tons of software available that wasn't available in other distributions at the time (such as office applications). This article will tell you why i use Arch Linux over other distributions like Ubuntu or Mint etc...

You should be using a tiling window manager if you want the best trade-off between customization, power, and simplicity.

Arch is lightweight and gives you the freedom to use whatever you want.

Linux is a playground. Play with your computer and make it better for yourself.

Why i use Arch Linux?

Introduction

I have been using Linux for more than 15 years now. It started with Red Hat 7.1, but then I moved to Debian which was a lot easier to use and had better packages available. Later on, I moved over to Arch Linux which was perfect for my needs because it was lightweight and had tons of software available that wasn't available in other distributions at the time (such as office applications). This article will tell you why i use Arch Linux over other distributions like Ubuntu or Mint etc...

Let's start by my journey with Linux

My journey with Linux began in 2020. I had been using Ubuntu since then, but it was a little bit too complicated for me at that time. Then I tried Arch Linux and found it easy to use and recommendable for any beginner who wants to learn about how to use the command line interface (CLI).

I used other distros as well, such as Manjaro or Antergos but always came back to Arch Linux since 2021 because of its simplicity, flexibility and power under one roof!

Why do i use it?

The rolling release model. A rolling release is a distribution that provides regular updates and installs new software packages, without user intervention. This means that you'll never have to worry about your system being outdated or out of date because it's constantly being updated.

Speed and stability in Linux are unparalleled compared to other operating systems, which makes archlinux incredibly fast and stable overall. Also, since there is no need for antivirus programs or other security measures on Arch Linux, this makes it an ideal platform for servers or workstations where speed and reliability are crucial factors in production environments such as web servers or DBAs (Data Base Administrators).

Freedom: Arch Linux comes with many different tools preinstalled allowing users full control over their systems without having any programming knowledge whatsoever! For example: There are multiple ways how one can customize the look-and-feel of Windows 10 via Paint Shop Pro 11 which allows users complete control over their operating system without much hassle at all - all thanks to Beryl Desktop Environments like Enlightenment E17 or MATE Desktop Environment etc...

What can be off-putting ?

However, you will need to learn a lot of things. The most important being that you need to configure and set up your system in order to use it properly.

The second thing is that it’s a large project with many components, which makes it more complicated than other operating systems. For example, there are no graphical user interfaces (GUIs) available for Arch Linux by default. This means you have to use the console instead of using your Mouse and Keyboard or touchpad/touchscreen devices on laptops or smartphones when working with this distro

Even if you will face a few problems, you will learn more about your system than ever before

It is not a surprise that you will face a few problems. Linux is an open source operating system and it has been developed by thousands of developers all around the world, which means there is always someone who can help you out if you need some help. You just need to ask them!

If you want to learn more about your system than ever before, then installing Arch Linux on your computer will be the best decision in your life because when we talk about computers, we usually think only about Windows or MacOS operating systems but what if we told you that there’s another way? There actually are many alternatives like Ubuntu (Free/Open Source), Debian GNU/Linux (GPL) etc., but one thing remains true: they all require lots of hard work from their users who have no idea how exactly everything works under hood because most of them don't know much about programming languages or web development techniques...

Conclusion

In conclusion, i think that the pros of this distribution outweigh any cons. Starting from the installation process which is very easy and fast, to the easy and fast updating process, it's an awesome experience. The community is very friendly and helpful, so you can always ask for help if there is something that doesn't work as expected (which usually happens). In my opinion it's one of the best distributions out there!
